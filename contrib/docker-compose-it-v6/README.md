# Developper Guide

This documentation shows how to easily start an Elasticsearch single node cluster
with a version 6.8 (EOL) just for test purposes.

## Launch Elastic Stack

Go to the `contrib/docker-compose-it-v6` dir and type:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Wait for everything to start. It could take several minutes.

## Stop Elastic Stack

Go to the `contrib/docker-compose-it` dir and type:

```sh
docker-compose down
```
