Version 2.2
===========

-  fscrawler comes with new default mappings for files. They have better
   defaults as they consume less disk space and CPU at index time. You
   should remove existing files in ``~/.fscrawler/_default/_mappings``
   before starting the new version so default mappings will be updated.
   If you modified manually mapping files, apply the modification you
   made on sample files.

-  ``excludes`` is now set by default for new jobs to ``["~*"]``. In
   previous versions, any file or directory containing a ``~`` was
   excluded. Which means that if in your jobs, you are defining any
   exclusion rule, you need to add ``*~*`` if you want to get back the
   exact previous behavior.

-  If you were indexing ``json`` or ``xml`` documents with the
   ``filename_as_id`` option set, we were previously removing the suffix
   of the file name, like indexing ``1.json`` was indexed as ``1``. With
   this new version, we donâ€™t remove anymore the suffix. So the ``_id``
   for your document will be now ``1.json``.
