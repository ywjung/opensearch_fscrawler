Version 2.6
===========

- FSCrawler comes now with multiple distributions, depending on the elasticsearch
  cluster you're targeting to run.

- ``elasticsearch.nodes`` settings using ``host``, ``port`` or ``scheme`` have been replaced by
  an easier notation using ``url`` setting like ``http://127.0.0.1:9200``. You will need to modify
  your existing settings and use the new notation if warned.
