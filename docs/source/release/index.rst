Release notes
=============

It can happen that you need to upgrade a mapping or reindex an entire
index before starting fscrawler after a version upgrade. Read carefully
the following update instructions.

To update fscrawler, just download the new version, unzip it in another
directory and launch it as usual. It will still pick up settings from
the configuration directory. Of course, you need to stop first the
existing running instances.
